# **Trends in second-line glucose-lowering therapy initiations and the impact on treatment outcomes across age and frailty groups in people with type 2 diabetes, 2019-2024: UK population-based study**

#### Analysis code repository

## Introduction

This repository contains the R code for "Trends in second-line glucose-lowering therapy initiations and the impact on treatment outcomes across age and frailty groups in people with type 2 diabetes, 2019-2024: UK population-based study" (link to be added).

The study uses data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to:

-   Describe contemporary population-level second-line prescribing trends after metformin.
-   Evaluate trends in short-term clinical outcomes following second-line treatment initiation including:
    -   12-month response outcomes: HbA1c, weight, treatment discontinuation
    -   Complicaiton outcomes with 12-months: severe diabetes-related complication, heart failure, kidney failure
-   Evaluate the impact of the 2022 NICE guideline update recommending broader use of SGLT2 inhibitors.
-   Assess whether trends differ in older adults with frailty, a high-risk population historically under-represented in clinical trials.

The analysis includes 117,064 adults initiating second-line therapy after metformin between 2019–2024.

| **DKA**                                                     | Hospital admission for diabetic ketoacidosis.                                                                                                   |

## Age–frailty groups

Frailty is based on the electronic frailty index (eFI).\
The three main analysis groups are:

-   **Age ≤ 70 years**
-   **Non-frail \> 70 years** (eFI: fit or mild)
-   **Frail \> 70 years** (eFI: moderate or severe)

## Repository Structure

This project is organised into:

-   **Analysis scripts** (in the main project folder): these use the functions to run the full analysis and produce all tables and figures for the paper.
-   **Function scripts** (in the functions/ folder): these contain all the functions for building the cohort, creating outcomes, running models and making plots.
